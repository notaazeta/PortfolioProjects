# COVID-19 Data Exploration Project (SQL)

This project demonstrates data exploration and analysis of a COVID-19 dataset using SQL. The goal is to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to cases, deaths, and vaccinations across countries and continents.

## Project Overview

- Explored global COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination trends.  
- Analyzed country-level, continent-level, and global statistics.  
- Calculated death percentages, infection rates, and vaccination coverage.  
- Prepared data for visualization and dashboard creation.

## Tools & Technologies

- SQL (Microsoft SQL Server)  
- COVID-19 datasets (Deaths and Vaccinations)

## Key Tasks Performed

- Aggregated data using `SUM`, `MAX`, and other SQL functions  
- Performed joins between deaths and vaccinations datasets  
- Used window functions, CTEs, and temporary tables  
- Created views for visualization in dashboards

## Repository Contents

- SQL scripts for data exploration and analysis  
- Views and temporary tables used for insights  
- Queries demonstrating global, country, and continent-level analysis

## Skills Demonstrated

- Data exploration and analysis with SQL  
- Complex SQL queries including joins, aggregations, window functions, and CTEs  
- Preparing data for visualization and dashboarding  
- Extracting actionable insights from real-world datasets
