COVID-19 Data Exploration Using SQL

This project focuses on exploring and analyzing a COVID-19 dataset using SQL to uncover trends, patterns, and key insights related to cases, deaths, and vaccinations across countries and continents.


Project Overview

Using SQL queries, this analysis examines:
COVID-19 infection and death trends
Country-level and continent-level comparisons
Global case and death statistics
Vaccination progress relative to population size

The project demonstrates the use of SQL for data exploration, aggregation, joins, window functions, CTEs, temporary tables, and views.


Tools & Technologies

SQL (Microsoft SQL Server)
COVID-19 Deaths & Vaccinations datasets


Key Analysis Performed

Total Cases vs Total Deaths
Calculated death percentages to understand fatality rates (with a focused analysis on Nigeria).

Total Cases vs Population
Analyzed the percentage of the population infected in different countries.

Highest Infection & Death Rates
Identified countries and continents with the highest infection and death counts.

Global COVID-19 Statistics
Aggregated global cases and deaths over time to observe worldwide trends.

Vaccination Analysis
Used joins, window functions, CTEs, and temporary tables to track rolling vaccination counts and vaccination percentages by population.


SQL Techniques Used

Aggregations (SUM, MAX)
Joins
Window functions (OVER, PARTITION BY)
Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
Temporary tables
Views for future visualization


Repository Contents

SQL scripts for COVID-19 data exploration
Queries used to generate insights and metrics
View created for visualization and dashboarding

Next Steps
Connect the SQL view to Power BI or Tableau
Build an interactive COVID-19 dashboard
Add visual insights and storytelling
